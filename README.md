# Eagle-Resort-Bar-Sales-Analysis


## A comprehensive sales analysis for a bar
The aim of this project is to provide detailed analysis and sales report for the bar section of the resort, the results from my analysis were used to make key decisions regarding the future of the business. With the help of my analysis the management were able to know the key performance index (KPI) of the business, top ten best selling products, sales by day, profit, generated revenue, profit by product, top ten least selling products, products that should be sold the most and why, products that should not be sold and why, total supply, stock, and trends.

### Methodology:
* Every data used for this project were gotten from the sales book which contains the day-to-day sales and were manually typed into an Excel sheet by me.
* I performed daily accounting with Microsoft Excel, and I sent the PDF format to the management daily for their own record and observation. I did this for two months while I was preparing my final analysis.
* At the end of the second month, I gathered every generated data into one excel file and I created a database for the business with MySQL.
* I cleaned the data for accuracy in delivery by standardization, removing duplicates and null values, populating empty columns, and correcting spelling errors. This were all done with MySQL workbench.
* I used MySQL workbench to find answers to a lot of questions regarding the bar sales from the generated data.
Finally, I created a Power BI dashboard for the management to have a comprehensive overview of the business performance.
